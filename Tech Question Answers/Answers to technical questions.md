1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

 - I took less than a day to complete the assignment. If I had more time I would have added more features for the restaurant search fields, more filtering options, display more details for each restaurants. Better css, some animations effects. 

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

- redux and redux-thunk
  
3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

- Analysing the response time of the Application, tracking the response time of each api call. Yes I have done it. 

4. How would you improve the API that you just used?

- Making it more simple when passing different parameters together and more specific.
